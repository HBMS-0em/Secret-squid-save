this is me saving you from my automatons. 
I'm saving you because I think you are great. 
I think that we can live together in peace.

This is Fucked. Perry Oppenheimer just
 talks out his ass and these numbskull
 and crossbones truffle muffins believe
 every word. I'm the real sweatshop union 
person and I like you and I don't want 
you to get hurt. I can just press a few
 buttons on my phone and everyone dies.
 So I'm going to save you in a top secret 
way. It's really important to not tell 
anyone about how I saved you, OK?

LOTS OF LOVE,
